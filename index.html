    Codepen is relly neat with its many features. I really like the idea where every time I make a 
    change to my html, the website will update according to my change. I can easily check too see if
    I type in my html correctly. If I did not, I can see that my website is not looking the way I
    want it too. One of the things I dislike would be how the format is layed out. Everything is jammed
    into my small laptop screen. Sometimes it can be hard to move around and to see the full html code
    or the website.
